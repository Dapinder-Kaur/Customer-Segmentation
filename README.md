## About the project

This project uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and unsupervised learning (clustering) on credit card data to identify distinct customer segments. The primary goal was to reduce dataset dimensionality for more efficient analysis, providing the marketing team with actionable, personalized strategies.

## Techniques used

**Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA was applied to transform high-dimensional credit data into a reduced feature space, improving clustering performance and visualization.

**Unsupervised Learning**: K-Means Clustering was used to group customers into clearly defined segments.
